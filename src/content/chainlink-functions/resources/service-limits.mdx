| Maximum duration of a request<br/>(Request fulfillment timeout) | The maximum duration of a request is the time allowed for processing a Chainlink Functions request from start to finish, covering all steps such as reading from the chain, executing code, and posting back on chain. If processing takes longer, the request times out, and no charges are applied to your subscription for that request. In such cases, the initially locked estimated request costs must be manually requested to be returned to your subscription balance | 5 minutes                                                                                               |
